# Handlebars Practice
This repository was created to help people practice using handlebars so that they can get a firmer comprehension of what it is and what it does with html and javascript code. You do not need to install Handlebars to utilize this repository as it is already included and referenced in the first script tag. 
Sample code has been provided. Credit to Derek Banas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HuAnM6b2d8 and Tutorial Zine https://tutorialzine.com/2015/01/learn-handlebars-in-10-minutes
Please review index.html, then app.js to understand how handlebars are used on a basic level. 
The code features different approaches to using Handlebars.
